## Why to use?

This is a shortcut to access your favourite anime series with your preferred providers, all in sync with the selected animes in your MyAnimeList profile.

Avoid surfing the internet or the providers looking for your episodes, just seat in and enjoy.

With this single page you can test several providers and update your MyAnimeList episodes easily.

It also skips some advertising from providers home sites, because you'll access to the episode page directly.

## How to use

Enter your MyAnimeList username _(https://myanimelist.net/profile/USERNAME)_, select your preferred provider and choose one of your animes to watch, then just enjoy your episode.

Click on "Next episode" at the top right corner of an episode to mark it as watched in your MyAnimeList profile.

When updating your watched episodes in MyAnimeList then the next episode will be shown, waiting for you to be watched.

## Features

- Some series have title synonyms, choose between original or alternative title in the settings of the anime.
